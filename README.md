## Tool for research of B-cells sequences similarity

•	Developing a tool on Python that will help the biologists to research the effects of Covid-19 on B-cells in subjects using data science techniques of Text Mining (NLP) and Networks Science.

•	The inputs are nucleotides sequences of B-cells in a subject.

•	The output is a network that represents the B-cells similarities.

•	Visualization of the findings on Gephi.

•	In association with lecturers and researchers from Biology and IS departments.

•	Lectured about the tool in the "Artathon" international meetup.
